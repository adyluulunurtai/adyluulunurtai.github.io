      <p>I (Nurtai) know that I am special and there's no one else out there that's like me... so enjoy! (smile).</p> 
      <p>I was born in Karakol on January 12, 1998. I had a very simple and happy childhood, and my only sibling, I'm the youngest in the family, I have two older brothers.</p>
      <p>After school I entered the law academy, but at the 2nd course I realized that it was not mine and started programming.</p>
      <p>
        Like my brothers, I am closed and completely happy when I watch quality movies in my spare time or use a personal computer ..</p>
